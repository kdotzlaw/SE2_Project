# Project Summary and Vision


### Test Plan and Sequence Diagrams
The project test plan and sequence diagrams are located: https://github.com/kdotzlaw/StudyBuddy/wiki/Sprint-2
The changlog is located: https://github.com/kdotzlaw/StudyBuddy/wiki/Changelog

### About
The Study Buddy is an application that allows students to keep track of their study progress with an incentive through a buddy that can be leveled up as they progress with their studies.  Being called “The Procrastinators,” as a team we felt this would be a great way to help students with their studies.

### Our Vision
The purpose of our Study Buddy is to help assist a student succeed in their academics while staying organized.

### Who will Study Buddy help?
Our primary stakeholders and stakeholders for this application are students who are currently enrolled in school.


# Core Features
The Study Buddy will have at least four functional features and one non-functional feature implemented.

### I. User Accounts (sprint 2)
This feature will allow users to create accounts that will allow them to sign in and out of the Study Buddy to save their progress.

### II. Track Study Time (sprint 2)
This feature will allow users to track their study time and be presented with the progress of their time usage over a period of time. 

### III. Calendar 
This feature will allow users to store any important dates and reminders and have it displayed in a scrollable list. This list will display the up coming important dates and how close it is to that date.

### IV. Grade Calculator
The grade tracker will allow users to enter and store their grades and also calculate their current grade in the course. An extension of this feature would be able to calculate grades a user would need to achieve on future assignments/tests/projects in order to obtain a certain letter grade.

### V. Capacity and User Requests
The Study buddy will have a capacity of 100 users and can handle 1000 requests per minute.

## Future Features

### VI. Buddy Level System
This feature will allow for users to level up their buddy.
